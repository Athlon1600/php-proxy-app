# php-proxy-app
Web Proxy Application built on [**php-proxy library**](https://github.com/Athlon1600/php-proxy) ready to be installed on your server. This is my personal fork of this project. The original can be found [here](https://github.com/Athlon1600/php-proxy-app).

# Installation
Using this project is simple. Simply clone the repository in to your web root folder on your server, enable SSL (I use [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)) and you're ready to go. If I was you I would change the page name, title and notice before making your version live.

# Issues
If there is an issue with the design of the proxy, make an issue here. If there is an issue with the proxy itself, head on over to Athlon1600's repo. This fork is (mostly) just a reskin.
